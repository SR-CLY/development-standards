# CLY Student Robotics Development standards

Over the last 2 years, we've had a lot of problems with development standards. People can't decide on how to write their code, how to style it, or how to edit it, and we've wasted way too long working on standards and trying to fix them. In a competition environment, this is less than good! Naturally, some guidelines need to be set down, because the closer our development standards are to eachother,the faster we can write our code, and the higher quality it will be. 

Unfortunately, we didn't have any kind of standards over the last 2 years, since we're so pathetically disorganised. Now enough is enough, and it's time for a change. Check the links below for some standards. If something isnt defined below, check [The PEP8 Standard](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).

Large amounts of this repo were taken from [@Homletmoo](//github.com/Homletmoo)'s original readme [Here](https://github.com/SR-CLY/2015-orig-readme/blob/master/README.md). But unfortunately I have even less to do now, so a re-write was in order.
