# CLY SR Editing Standards

The most important thing for editing is to understand that both the Python IDLE, and the online IDE both use spaces. This means that when editing through any other text editor, _you must use 4 spaces for indenting_. Python doesnt really care how much yu indent, or if you use tabs vs spaces, as long as you keep it the same between files.

If you can avoid it, don't use the online IDE or IDLE for any editing, use a different, and far superior text editor, like [Sublime Text]() or [Notepad++](), which have some very cool extra features and allow you to specify tabs or spaces. Which makes using the same standard much easier.
